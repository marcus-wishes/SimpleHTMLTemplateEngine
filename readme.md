# Simple Template Engine
This is a prototype of a simple template engine for HTML (although it can be used in other text environments as well), written in C++11 in 2015.
Although it was used in production in another project back then, I don't consider it ready to be used.

It doesn't have any dependencies, and I did not use or test it since 2015. 
I do not recommend it to be used, and there are much better solutions out there.
